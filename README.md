# polymerAndFirebaseProj
A sandbox for functionality I will be using on another project - 
this project aims to provide a secure solution to firebase data 
storage from clientside only to ensure data limits, authentication, 
and crossbranch integrity.

Instructions:
1. Clone this project then 
2. cd into your bower_components directory 
   mkdir firebase-element cd into it 
3. Clone fromSpace/firebase-element to current directory

This entirety of firebase-element is not in bower
also a simple correction was necassary to make it work
